Maybe a big test: 

call /, check that you have a "plz auth" error
  { "error": "you are not currently logged in"}
call /logout, check that you have a "plz auth" error
  { "error": "you are not currently logged in"}
call /signup, 
  { "username": string
  , "password": string }
  with a GET
  { "error": "must be POST request"}
  with data format error
  { "error": "keys username: string and password: string must be set"}
  with an existing user
  { "error": "username [username] already exists"}
  { "status": "okay"}
call /login
  with data format error
  { "error": "keys username: string and password: string must be set"}
  with incorrect data
  { "error": "this username/password pair does not match an existing user"}
call /, check info is valid
  { "username": "[username]" }
call /logout
  // dubious but eh
  { "status": "okay" }
call /, check that you have a "plz auth" error
  { "error": "you are not currently logged in"}
call /logout, check that you have a "plz auth" error
  { "error": "you are not currently logged in"}
